# lf Documentation - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gokcehan/lf
# Note on Image Previews
# 1. ueberzug must be installed.
# 2. The scope file (~/.config/lf/scope for me), must have a command similar to
#    mine to generate ueberzug images.
# 3. A `set cleaner` line as below is a cleaner script.
# 4. lf should be started through a wrapper script (~/.local/bin/lfup for me)
#    that creates the environment for ueberzug. This command can be be aliased
#    in your shellrc (`alias lf="lfub") or if set to a binding, should be
#    called directly instead of normal lf.
